# Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

This project demonstrates the application of linear regression using the gradient descent algorithm. The goal is to predict a target variable based on input features, following a comprehensive data preprocessing phase.

## Project Overview

In this project, we:
- **Preprocess the data**: Handle missing values (NaN values) and remove outliers to ensure data quality.
- **Apply Linear Regression**: Use the gradient descent algorithm to minimize the cost function and find the best-fit line.
- **Visualize the Results**: Plot the regression line and data points using the `matplotlib` library.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Handle NaN values using techniques like mean/median imputation.
  - Identify and remove outliers based on statistical methods (e.g., Z-score or IQR).
- **Gradient Descent Algorithm**:
  - Implemented from scratch.
  - Fine-tune the learning rate and number of iterations for optimal performance.
- **Plotting and Visualization**:
  - Use `matplotlib` to visualize the data and the resulting regression line.
